/*Consider the classical producer-consumer problem: a group of P producer threads and a group of C consumer threads share a bounded circular buffer of size N. If the buffer is not full,
* producers are allowed to add elements; if the buffer is not empty, consumers can consume elements. Write a program that can correctly coordinate the producers and consumers and 
* their depositing and retrieving activities. For simplicity we assume that we have the same number T of producers and consumer threads. T and N are program arguments.
